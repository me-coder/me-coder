- 👋 Hi, I’m me-coder
- 👀 I have interests in DevOps, Cloud, Automation and Python. Also, various Development strategies and some off-beat, but related topics like [Nix](https://nixos.org/learn/), [Podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/), [Kata containers](https://katacontainers.io/learn/), [Firecracker microVM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) and such.
